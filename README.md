# Kinematic-Modelling-of-the-FrankaEmikaPanda-Robot
Modelling the Forward &amp; Inverse Kinematics of a FrankaEmikaPanda Robot<br><br>
In this, a FrankaEmikaPanda Robot has been analysed, and the forward and inverse kinematic model of the same has been modelled in Python 3 and Matlab respectively. Specifics related to the modelling, pictures, and results have been described in detail in the report.<br><br>
The DH parameters and the figure displaying the same have been referred from <a href="https://petercorke.com/robotics/franka-emika-panda-kinematics-and-singularities/">this</a> wonderful article by Peter Coke.<br><br>
This project has been done by my colleague Parnavi and I, under the guidance of Dr. Ekta Singla from IIT Ropar.
